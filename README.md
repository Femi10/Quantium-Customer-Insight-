# Sales Analytics and Customer-Insight


The objective of this project is to conduct an analysis of the client’s transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations

Specific area of focus includes:

• Cleaning the data, Identifying missing values and outliers

• Customer Spend Analytics

• Product type and Size Analytics

• Customer Segment, in relation to Spend and Product Analytics


Based on the analysis, the following was recommended:

Create promotions for Young Singles to buy more Smith chips, and they are the only segment who buys Doritos more than smith chips, this shows that there is an opportunity to scale up on Doritos in that segment.

Consider making smaller chip sizes attractive, especially if they have a higher profit margin than the larger packs.

Increase marketing promotions for other brands that have mid-level patronage such as Grainwaves, RRD, WW, Cobs, and Tostitos to name a few so that they can compete favourably with the top brands
