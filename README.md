**Recommedations **

create promotions for Young Singles to buy more Smith chips, and they are the only segment who buys Doritos more than smith chips, this shows that there is an opportunity to scale up on Doritos in that segment.

Consider making smaller chip sizes attractive, especially if they have higher profit margin than the larger packs.

Increase marketing promotions for other brands that has mid-level patronage such as Grainwaves, RRD, WW, Cobs, and Tostitos to name a few so that they can compete favorably with the top brands
